**Online Boutique** is a cloud-native microservices demo application.
Online Boutique consists of a 11-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

**Google uses this application to demonstrate use of technologies like
Kubernetes/GKE, Istio, Stackdriver, gRPC and OpenCensus**. This application
works on any Kubernetes cluster, as well as Google
Kubernetes Engine. Itâ€™s **easy to deploy with little to no configuration**.

**We will be using this repo to demonstrate Observability concepts in O & M workshop. 
Branch obs-exercise-1 can be used for completing Exercise 1 of the workshop.

## Pre-requisites

1. GKE Cluster should be created. Optionally, istio can be setup. If istio has not been setup, please follow instructions to setup istio.

## Building Service Locally

1. **Deploy the sample app to the cluster.**

```
kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
```

5. **Wait for the Pods to be ready.**

```
kubectl get pods
```

After a few minutes, you should see:

```

shippingservice-6ccc89f8fd-v686r         1/1     Running   0          2m58s
```

7. **Access the web frontend in a browser** using the frontend's `EXTERNAL_IP`.

```
kubectl get service frontend-external | awk '{print $4}'
```

*Example output - do not copy*

```
EXTERNAL-IP
<your-ip>
```

**Note**- you may see `<pending>` while GCP provisions the load balancer. If this happens, wait a few minutes and re-run the command.

8. [Optional] **Clean up**:

```
gcloud container clusters delete onlineboutique \
    --project=${PROJECT_ID} --zone=${ZONE}
```

## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC. See the [Development Principles](/docs/development-principles.md) doc for more information.
